# Pixel_Car

**Pixel Car** is a small repository for cars. For now, it is just an API. I did this project in order to link Mongodb & Express. This project is based on this Medium article : https://medium.com/@dinyangetoh/how-to-build-simple-restful-api-with-nodejs-expressjs-and-mongodb-99348012925d.

Technologies and languages used are the following :

- A **brand** *(Mercedes, Audi, BMW (because we like Germany))*
